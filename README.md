# Some notes

### Css naming for header and footer component

.container will span the entire window width
<br>
.contentWrapper is wrapper to limit the width of the content
<br>

- Style the layout with contentWrapper,
- Style the colors, borders, etc with container

to put it simply : container is parent, and contentWrapper is child
you should <b>ALWAYS</b> use above naming to make it clear, PLEASE!!

# NOTE

- Fix link styles on Header.module.css, make it to not affect other links, also fix navBtn and link style
