# React template

Vite react template with vitest added.

## To start reacting

Read `package.json`, but here's something you will need

```bash
npm install # Setup packages
npm run dev # Start dev server
npm run test # Start test
```

Note: `.gitkeep` is used as placeholder for empty directoris. It can be remove when you have files for them (you can ignore them)

## Files structure

I don't know much myself, just follow the standard way, I might add/change something in the future (as I learn).
